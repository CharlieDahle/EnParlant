"En Parlant" is a Chrome extension designed to enhance language 
learning and translation convenience within the browser. It serves
dual purposes: facilitating quick translations and providing 
definitions / thesaurus for selected words or phrases. The extension uses
HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and and JavaScript for frontend interactions, Node.js
and Express for the backend server, and SQLite for database 
management. It integrates with DeepL's external APIs for translation, and 
offers the user the ability to save words or phrases for review later.
